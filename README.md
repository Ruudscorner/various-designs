# Various Designs
Various small designs and home improvements.

## Electrical Box Spacers
This is the first design in this repository.

For when the electrical box in your wall is too far in and you have to use spacers to level it with the wall.

It comes pre-made with these heights:
- 7mm
- 9mm
- 11mm
- 12mm

These where the heights I needed when creating this project. If you know Fusion 360 it would take you longer to open the file than change it to the height you need.

## Printing
For printing a finished design open the .stl file in the slicer for your printer and from there you should be able to print the spacers. A slicer is the software program that prepares the object for printing and outputs the G-code.
